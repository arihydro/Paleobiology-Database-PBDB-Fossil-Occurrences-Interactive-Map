This notebook fetches fossil occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) API and plots them on interactive maps using Folium (Leaflet) and Plotly.
It demonstrates:

Making API calls with parameters for time window (Ma), geographic bounding box, and taxon
Handling JSON → pandas DataFrame
Visualizing results on an interactive map
